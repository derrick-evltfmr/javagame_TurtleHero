# TurtleHero (Protect my Turtle Village) \[Java Game]
Turtle Hero is a simple game project that I developed in the end of my first year of Computer Science, which was a class project of Object Oriented Programming class (UCO). The Game Engine (Double Buffer Image Render and gameLoop using GameData.update) was taught in class and provided by the class instructor Dr. Hung Sung. Based on the basic game engine, student needs to build their own game.

The game was not developed perfectly though, there were still a lot could be improved, especially the game level design. It was a very good practical project for me, while I had just learnt some basic idea of CS and some syntax in Java. This project let me have a great chance to practice and it did help me a lot in my later study in CS.
